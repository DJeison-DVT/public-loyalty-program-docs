This document outlines best practices, design suggestions based on SOLID/GRASP principles, and testing/security considerations for each module in the loyalty platform.

---
## 👤 1. User & Role Management
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **SRP**: Separate tier logic from the user model.
- **OCP**: User filters should be extendable (e.g., add chain later).
- **GRASP**: Use `UserSegmentService` to encapsulate filtering logic.
### 🔐 Security
- Sanitize user input to avoid role tampering.
- Avoid exposing full user data to client apps.
### 🧪 Testing
- Unit tests for segment matching logic.
- Integration tests for filtering across tiers/regions.
---
## 🎯 2. Objective & Points System
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **SRP**: Separate evaluation logic (e.g., `ObjectiveEvaluator`).
- **DIP**: Inject services for point management and evaluation.
- **GRASP**: Use controllers/services to orchestrate point awarding.
### 🔐 Security
- Prevent double submission of objectives.
- Validate ownership of objectives before processing.
### 🧪 Testing
- Unit test `PointManager` and `ObjectiveEvaluator` in isolation.
- Validate point totals and objective state transitions.
---
## 📊 3. Excel Sales Input
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **SRP**: Parsing and application logic should be separate.
- **LSP**: Allow for CSV/JSON input via interchangeable interfaces.
### 🔐 Security
- Whitelist trusted file sources (authenticated uploads only).
- Validate schema and format to avoid injection.
### 🧪 Testing
- Unit test file parser with various formats.
- Fuzz test malformed Excel files.
---
## 🎁 4. Prize Redemption
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **OCP**: Use strategy pattern for `PrizeRedemptionHandler`.
- **ISP**: Keep interfaces for digital and physical prizes minimal and focused.
- **GRASP**: Redemption service should not know delivery logic.
### 🔐 Security
- Prevent multiple redemptions with race condition locks.
- Validate user points before deducting.
### 🧪 Testing
- Unit test each redemption strategy.
- Integration test full redemption → delivery flow.

## 🎬 5. Communication Videos / Academia
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **SRP**: Quiz logic should not be in video model.
- **OCP**: Allow for other quiz types by extending evaluator.
- **GRASP**: Questionnaire service owns completion logic.
### 🔐 Security
- Rate-limit quiz submission attempts.
- Sanitize free-text inputs if applicable.
### 🧪 Testing
- Unit test scoring and answer evaluation.
- Validate correct flagging of completions.
---
## ⚡ 6. Flash Events
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **OCP**: Add new event types via `EventActionHandler` subclasses.
- **GRASP**: Event handler should not alter unrelated systems.
### 🔐 Security
- Validate participation based on eligibility.
- Monitor for abuse (e.g., multiple entries).
### 🧪 Testing
- Event completion logic with expiration handling.
- Participation logs validation.
---
## 🛠️ 7. Admin Dashboard
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **SRP**: Break out prize, content, user, and report tools separately.
- **DIP**: Interact with services, not models directly.
### 🔐 Security
- Strict RBAC enforcement.
- Log all admin actions for auditing.
### 🧪 Testing
- UI testing with restricted and elevated roles.
- Test report downloads and file formats.
---
## 💬 8. WhatsApp Bot
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **DIP**: Inject all data services (e.g., user info, redemption).
- **GRASP**: Route messages via handlers to keep logic testable.
### 🔐 Security
- Authenticate message sender with phone/token match.
- Never expose sensitive info (codes) without validation.
### 🧪 Testing
- Bot command handler testing.
- Test WhatsApp fallback for unread messages.
---
## 🔐 9. Audit Logs
### 🔧 SOLID/GRASP Suggestions
- **SRP**: Logger should only log, not act.
- **GRASP**: Use middleware or decorators to handle automatically.
### 🔐 Security
- Prevent tampering or log deletion.
- Mask sensitive data in logs.
### 🧪 Testing
- Validate logging triggers for all key flows.
- Redact sensitive data correctly.

## 🌐 General Engineering Guidelines
- ✅ Favor composition over inheritance for flexibility.
- ✅ Use DTOs to protect internal data models from external exposure.
- ✅ Centralize error handling and response formatting.
- ✅ Avoid shared mutable state in services.
- ✅ Use optimistic locking where applicable (e.g., redemptions).
