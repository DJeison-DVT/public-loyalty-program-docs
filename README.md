# ðŸ“¦ Loyalty Platform Documentation

This repository contains the planning, architecture, and implementation references for the **Loyalty Program Platform**, an internal system used to manage sales-based objectives, reward redemptions, communications, and performance tracking across various user roles. The platform spans three major modules: a FastAPI backend, a WhatsApp bot, and a React web app.

---

## ðŸ§­ Project Overview

The loyalty program is divided into three phases:

1. **WhatsApp MVP**: Core point/objective system with prize redemption via WhatsApp.
2. **Web Platform MVP**: Web-based dashboards for users and prize interactions.
3. **Administration & Segmentation**: Full admin CMS, reporting tools, segmented academy content, and audit logs.

Key goals include:

* Modular and maintainable architecture
* Scalable to regional, tier-based, and role-based access
* Clear documentation for each subsystem and role
